# Definition
The **cross product** between two vectors $$\vec{a}$$ and $$\vec{b}$$ is defined by
<p align="center">
    $$ \vec{a} \times \vec{b} := ||\vec{a}||||b||sin(\theta)\vec{n}$$
</p>
where $$\theta$$ is the angle between $$\vec{a}$$ and $$\vec{b}$$ in the plane they lie in and $$\vec{n}$$ is a unit vector perpendicular to this plane.

The **cross product** in 3-dimensions is equivalent to the determinant of
$$\right. 
\begin{vmatrix}
1 & 3 & 2 & -6 \\ 
1 & 2 & -2 & -5 \\ 
2 & 4 & -2 & -9 \\ 
2 & 4 & -6 & -9  \notag
\end{vmatrix}$$
