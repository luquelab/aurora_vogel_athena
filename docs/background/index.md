# Background

**How is it done today?**

Currently the theory of elongated capsids only includes hexagonal lattices, while there is no solid theory for generating conical structures. Previous attempts involved using the CK framework and have failed to capture known examples.

**Who cares?**

Our lab, structural biologists, biotechnologists, applied geometers, biomedical scientists and engineers.

**What difference will it make?**

The extended elongated capsid theory will serve as a quantitative means for studying viral evolution, allow targeted antiviral strategies to be developed that work generically, and offer finer control in capsid engineering. A conical capsid theory, which includes well known examples, would be a first of its kind and would be testable against molecular models such as those of HIV obtained from cryo-EM reconstructions (Zhao et al, 2013). An accurate structural model for HIV would, for example, allow for novel antiviral strategies against HIV.

**What is new in your approach?**

A theory of conical capsids, separate from CK, has not been attempted. My approach will involve assigning _T_-numbers, $$T_{small}$$ and $$T_{large}$$, for each cap of the capsid, where our working hypothesis is that the $$T_{small}$$ and $$T_{large}$$ belong to the same _P_-class. The mathematical theory behind elongated viral structures assumes a hexagonal lattice. Exchanging the hexagonal lattice for one of the additional Archimedean lattices. 

In both cases, new structure will arise which will be explored and characterized. This will include deriving the radius of each cap, length, positions of proteins, protein stoichiometry rules, icosahedral class P, _T_-numbers, and the icosahedral lattice.
