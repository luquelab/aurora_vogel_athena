# Synthesis

My project centers around extending the theory of elongated and conical viral capsids to include not only the hexagonal lattice and its dual but the additional Archimedean lattices reported in the recent _Nature Communications_ article (Luque and Reguera, 2010; Twarock and Luque, 2019). The result is a rich new structure to be explored and characterized. Such exploration will include derivations for key structural components such as the radius of each cap, length, positions of proteins, protein stoichiometry rules, icosahedral class P, and T-numbers.
