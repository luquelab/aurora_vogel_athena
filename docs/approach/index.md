# Approach

**What are the risks and payoffs?**

The main risk is that the extending of the theory for the elongated and conical structures is not feasible in the given time frame. For the elongated structures, this is highly unlikely, since the extension of the theory will involve a straightforward replacement of the lattice, which will result in adjusted lattice vectors ($$C_Q$$,$$C_T^{120}$$). The corresponding changes in the mathematical structure need to be merely catalogued. 

For the conical structures, a construction involving $$T_{small}$$ and $$T_{large}$$ and a shared _P_-class has already been done for a handful examples successfully. The challenge is in generalizing the construction, which involves some uncertainty. 

The main payoffs are mentioned in (5). An additional payoff is that a set of previously unclassified or misclassified viruses is now classifiable. This will enhance our understanding of such viruses as it is our hypothesis that the structural classifications are tied to viral replication strategies and types of capsid protein folds.
