&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Aurora Vogel and I am an Applied Maths M.S. Student as SDSU. I am a part of the [Luque Lab](https://www.luquelab.com/) which conducts research centered around the structural and ecological properties of viruses. My research interests include the mathematical underpinnings of capsid structures. My current goals include expanding the mathematical foundations of elongated and conical capsid structures of viruses alongside creating 3D models of said structures. Currently, I am in the process of formally writing out the maths behind the icosahedral, elongated, and conical structures.
